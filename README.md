# Transformenator

Transformenator is a tool (a set of tools, really) that makes it possible to do some very in-depth conversion of files from one "format" to another. It turns out that this is really, really useful when faced with files from ancient word processors, for example. They used all kinds of crazy binary annotations within a file (this is before the days of text markup, remember). With Transformenator, it's easy to swap out those binary annotations for HTML or RTF tags that all of a sudden make those ancient files readable again, maybe even with their original formatting and highlighting intact. Many samples come built into Transformenator that can make such file conversions easy.

There are some other things Transformenator can do that are along these same lines - extracting individual files from a disk image of some very ancient computers, converting structured records in a file into Comma Separated Values (CSV) for use in a modern spreadsheet, and some other miscellaneous utilities to aid repetitive conversion of lots of related files.
