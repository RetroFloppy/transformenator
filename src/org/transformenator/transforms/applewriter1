; Transform binary Applewriter 1.0 to ASCII - mostly just strips high bits off
;
; When extracting files with CiderPress, ensure you pay attention to these attributes:
;   "Convert to non-Apple II formats" <<<< uncheck
;   "Don't convert text files" <<<< check
;
; Some command-line environments may do a little chicanery with data passed via stdin -
;   if transforms aren't working the way you expect, are missing transforms especially on
;   bytes greater than 0x7f, try passing the literal file instead of stdin, or set your 
;   console encoding appropriately (-Dconsole.encoding=<your local encoding>).
