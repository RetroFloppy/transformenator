<h1>Transformenator</h1>
Transformenator is something that should be possible to do with some rudimentary shell scripting.  
You should be able to run a binary file thorugh sed or awk and have byte sequences to different byte sequences.  
But you can't.
You could probably run a file through a hex dumper, change hex values, then un-transform it back to binary.
But that's kind of a pain too.
<p>
Since I am a Java guy, I used the tool that was easiest for me to implement cross-platform... a Java program.
<h2>Useage</h2>
Invoke the transformenator jar file from any command line, ant script, or what have you.
Standard in and standard out are the before and after streams.
Specify a transform "script" (with the <code>-t [filename]</code> option) to transform byte patterns.
<p>
For example:
<xmp>
java -jar transformenator.jar -t transform.txt < infile.bin > outfile.bin
</xmp>
<p>
Where:<br>
<code>transform.txt</code> is the set of transformations you want to make<br>
<code>infile.bin</code> is the original file<br>
<code>outfile.bin</code> is the resulting file after running the transforms
<p>
A sample <code>transform.txt</code> file might look like this:
<xmp>
; Change 0x00 to 0x20
00 = 20
</xmp>
Semicolons denote comment lines.
The left side of the equals sign is always a byte pattern, given in hex digits, with no other decoration.
The right side can be blank, another byte pattern given in hex, or if surrounded in double quotes, ASCII text.
For example:
<xmp>
; 0x86 appeared at the beginning of files sometimes, after the preamble.  Remove it.
86 =
; Start of heading
83 = "\par\par\pard\s2\b\fs36 "
; Italics on
b12d31 = "\i "
; Italics off
b12d30 = "\i0 "
</xmp>
